    "## Introduction <a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "Previously, we developed a program to auto-encode every record in the Virginia court data by expungability under the new law: either automatic, petition, automatic or petition pending a mandatory waiting period, or not eligible for expungement. We also automatically coded the reasons for each expungement decision, and phrased the reasons in the language of the new law. We then constructed a loop that applied these auto-encoders to each individuals' records in the Virginia court data. We saved the data in a Postgres database on our Oracle cloud virtual computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, we load the data and summarize it in ways that provide answers to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many records qualify as automatic, automatic (pending), petition, petition (pending), or not expungeable, in every by year in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How do these counts break down by race?\n",

    "3. What are the most frequent reasons for each expungability outcome?\n",

    "4. How do these reasons differ by race?\n",

    "We can now generate a cross-tabulation of race and expungability outcome. The following table contains row percents: of all records from a person of the given race, what percent falls within each expungability outcome?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note to holden:\n",
    "<i> - what this is saying: for each race, what percentage of those races fall into a certain category for expungeability: not eligilble, automatic petition, etc... <br>\n",
    "    important thing to clarify: these percentages are just within each category -- so of all the white people with criminal records, 8.5% of thsoe records are under the automatic category, 2.92% are automatic (pending) 35.99% are not eligible, etc. <br>\n",
    "    - quickly looking at the rest of these, black (non-hispanic) has the most \"not eligible\" with white (non-hispanic) having hte second most, by percentage  ... interesting to look at that by percentage because it could indicate something systemic: more black people are being convicted (or at least charged) for crimes that are more severe than other races <br>\n",
    "    - another interesting thing that jumped out to me is the really high petition counts for hispanic and american indian / alaskan native across both petition and petition (pending) ... the reason why this is potentially problematic is based on the difficulties that come along with finding legal representation to actually petition this process ... if these groups are poor on average in the state of virginia, even if the law allows them to petition for expungement, then the likelihood of them ever actually petitioning seems low.\n",

    "    - the biggest thing here that jumps out is just how small the percentage value of \"automatic (pending)\" is across all the races! it's great that there is going to be this new push for automatic but man if it's affecting this few people then who cares? the vast majority of these cases still fall to either petition (people could petition right now) or petition pending (people can petition once the new law is enacted in 2025) ... this means that +50% of people will still have to find representation and navigate the legal process themselves in order to get their record expunged <br>\n",
    "    - my first thought from that is that we need to bump up the # of things that are considered automatic for expungement <br>\n",
    "    - if that's not possible then we need to look deeper at what the petition process for expungement really looks like and how that could adversely affect people based on socio-economic status ... https://casetext.com/statute/code-of-virginia/title-192-criminal-procedure/chapter-232-sealing-of-criminal-history-record-information-and-court-records/section-192-39212-sealing-of-offenses-resulting-in-a-deferred-and-dismissed-disposition-or-conviction-by-petition <br>\n",
